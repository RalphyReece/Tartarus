# Tartarus
Based on Dwarffortress. A very simplified approach meant to run inside the terminal.

Important things to note

Many things are completely unusable, such as any world size except micro, some biomes like savannah, and saving worlds.
Go for Alpine and Forest as the biome of choice.
Currently no gameplay, just animals roaming and fighting.
Many bugs at this state.
Prone to slowing down to a crawl speed.
Many bugs can cause flashing lights, so be cautious.

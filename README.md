# Tartarus
Based on Dwarffortress. A very simplified approach meant to run inside the terminal.

Important things to note

Many things are completely unusable, such as any world size except micro, some biomes like savannah, and saving worlds.
Go for Alpine and Forest to see the most support
Currently no gameplay, just animals roaming and fighting.
Many bugs at this state.
Prone to slowing down to a crawl speed if using high render distance (default or lower is best).
Rendering bugs can cause flashing lights.

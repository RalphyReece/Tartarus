# Tartarus
Based on Dwarffortress. A very simplified approach meant to run inside the terminal.

Important things to note

Alpha versions are going to be ultra buggy, partially due to my stupid habits
-Small screen/font will crash the game. Go to fullscreen/ use CMD - or CNTRL - to zoom out.
-No Error passing. One error crashes the entire game.

Go to Releases for archived versions.

# Tartarus
Based on Dwarffortress. A very simplified approach meant to run inside the terminal.

Important things to note

not all biomes are completely supported. Forest will be prioritised.
Micro is the only world size currently supported.
Can not load a current game. If the terminal closes, the data remains, but is not yet loadable.

Alpha versions are going to be ultra buggy, partially due to my stupid habits

Small screen/font will crash the game. Go to fullscreen/ use CMD - or CNTRL - to zoom out.

Expect crashes frequently

Go to Releases for archived versions.
